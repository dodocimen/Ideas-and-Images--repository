          <h2>about</h2>
          <p>
            This project looks at how ideas change — how we’re influenced,
            broken down, and built back up again.
            <br />
            <br />
            Words like "COPY", "BREAK", "REBUILD" appear on screen. At first,
            the letters come together neatly. But after a moment, they break
            apart and start to drift in random directions. When the user clicks,
            a new word appears, and the letters move into place again — starting
            the cycle over.
            <br />
            <br />
            The drifting is controlled by Perlin noise, giving it a soft,
            natural feel. The letters are also gently pulled toward the mouse,
            showing how influence doesn’t have to be loud — sometimes it’s
            subtle. A final tile-based warping effect distorts the letters even
            more, showing how nothing stays the same for long. This piece is
            about how we're shaped by what we go through.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ideas shift, break down, and change form — and that’s how we grow.
            Influence is always happening, sometimes quietly, always moving.

          <h2>Poster Influenced By:</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Designer – David Brodsky</b>
            <br />
            I’m drawn to David Brodsky’s work because of his strong use of size
            contrast. He often places large elements next to much smaller ones
            to create visual tension and highlight meaning — something I also
            enjoy doing in my own work. It’s a simple technique, but it creates
            a bold impact.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Illustrator – Patrick O’Keefe </b>
            <br />
            I admire Patrick O’Keefe for his free, expressive line work and
            vibrant colors. His illustrations feel spontaneous and full of
            energy, yet still focused. That balance between freedom and impact
            really inspires me — it shows how loose, emotional design can still
            communicate something powerful.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Photographer – Nick Brandt</b>
            <br />
            Nick Brandt’s photography stands out to me because of its intensity
            and raw emotion. In his photography series, he captures wild animals
            in human-dominated environments, and that contrast makes his work
            feel haunting and honest. I’m especially inspired by the way he uses
            composition to tell a deeper story — it’s not just about beauty,
            it’s about truth and disruption.
