        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>
          I made this project as a way to explore the idea of "DIY" in a
          digital, interactive format. It was inspired by another piece I worked
          on, where I built words out of real objects—like broken pencils and
          metal bits like chains & screws.
          <br />
          <br />
          I wanted to bring that same handmade, experimental feel into a
          screen-based experience. In W0RD, the user types in a word, and
          scattered images—like chains, tapes, screws, or a mix—start drifting
          into place to form that word. It ends up looking like a collage built
          from scraps. The user gets to pick the image set they like, and they
          can also save the final result as an image.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are also floating leftover images that avoid the formed word,
          which adds a nice sense of movement and keeps the focus on the design.
          So in a way, this is my take on digital DIY—building words out of
          pieces and letting the user have a hand in the final creation.

          This project was inspired by two tracks—one that’s totally in my
          comfort zone, and another that challenged me and made me step out of
          it.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Song 1- Headup by Deftones</b>
          <br />

          Headup by Deftones is one of my favorite songs. It feels rough, loud,
          and full of emotion with heavy guitars and an offbeat melody that
          gives it a perfectly messy sound. The song talks about how messed up
          things can get, especially inside your head. I tried to match the same
          energy as the music was raw, edgy, and full of noise and feeling. To
          emphasize that, I used different screws and metal parts scattered
          throughout the composition, adding to the disorder and texture. Song
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>2- “Hello by Adele”</b>
          <br />
          For my second piece, I chose to spell out “Hello” using broken
          pencils. Hoping to reflect the vibes of Adele’s song which to me, it
          sounded like a feeling of being broken, yet still trying to reach out.
          Choosing this type of song was outside my comfort zone because I
          usualyl listen to either rock music or edm, but this allowed me to
          explore vulnerability.
