            When the mouse moves without clicking, only small, scattered letters
            appear — quiet, almost like whispers. But when the mouse is pressed
            and held, the screen reacts strongly: the background flashes between
            red and black, and full words like "MASCULINE," "PRIDE," "EGO,"
            "TOXIC" appear quickly.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was meant to show how small thoughts can grow into bigger,
            louder feelings — especially when it comes to the pressure of
            certain identities. The flashing background and fast motion
            represent how intense and overwhelming those emotions can feel.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s about how something that starts small can explode when held in
            for a long time.

            This project is about breaking stereotypes around “traditional”
            gender roles often associated with men, particularly when it comes
            to hobbies and activities. Society tends to excuse traditionally
            masculine activities with phrases like “boys will be boys,” but
            often ridicules men for engaging in tasks perceived as
            “traditionally feminine”.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this example, the project highlights the act of sewing—a task
            frequently linked to femininity and womanhood. Sewing is often seen
            as a “feminine” activity, something society expects women to do. By
            showcasing a man sewing—someone who doesn’t fit the typical idea of
            masculinity—the project challenges and redefines these assumptions.
            The goal isn’t to reinforce stereotypes but to challenge them: A man
            is engaging in something considered “feminine.”
            <br />
            <br />
            He fits the usual image of what a man is “supposed” to be. By
            sewing, he questions both traditional masculinity and femininity. He
            shows that men can confidently do things society labels as “for
            women.” This project uses stereotypes not to agree with them but to
            challenge and push back against them, ultimately showing that people
            can define themselves however they choose.
