          <h2>about</h2>
          <p>
            This project is a re-imagined, interactive version of my poster for
            the movie Maze Runner. I wanted to take the core idea — being
            trapped in a maze with only one way out — and turn it into something
            the user can feel and experience through interaction.
            <br />
            <br />
            The maze is built using words like "WICKED IS GOOD", forming the
            walls. You control a small red ball, guiding it through the maze
            toward the green “EXIT”. Movement works across devices — arrow keys,
            drag-and-drop on desktop, or tapping buttons on mobile.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you hit a wall or let go while dragging, the maze resets. On
            mobile, holding down buttons speeds up the movement, adding urgency
            — just like the tension in the movie.
            <br />
            <br />
            This final project acts as a movie teaser — not just for the film,
            but for the full experience of this course. It’s fast-paced,
            challenging, and layered with meaning, tying together typography,
            motion, and storytelling in a playful, game-like format.

              <h2>Rationale</h2>
              <p>
                I designed this poster for The Maze Runner using elements from
                the movie to make it feel meaningful and intense. The maze walls
                are built from the line “WICKED IS GOOD,” which is an important
                phrase from the story. It shows how the maze and the people
                behind it are connected.
              </p>
              <p>
                In front of the maze entrance, there are three red commas. This
                points to a scene where a character is pushed into the maze.
                <br />
                <br />
                The colors red and black were used to create a strong, serious
                feeling. Red stands for danger and fear, while black adds
                mystery and darkness. The goal was to make something simple but
                powerful, with little details that fans would recognize.
